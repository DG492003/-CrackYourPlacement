Time Complexity: O( N*(2M) ) ~ O(2 N*M)
Space complexity: O(1)

Step 1: Establish Base Case Conditions Check if the base case conditions are met, return the head if it is null or has no next pointer to head as thereâ€™s no further flattening or merging required.
Step 2: Recursively Merge the List:
    Initiate the recursive flattening process by calling `flattenLinkedList` on the next node (`head -> next`).
    The result of this recursive call is the head of the flattened and merged linked list.
Step 3: Merge Operations:
    Inside the recursive call, call the merge function which takes care of the merging of these two lists based on their data values.
    Read more about merging two linked lists here.
    The merged list is updated in the head, which is then returned as the result of the flattening process.*/
